description = "John Binzak is angraduate from the University of Wisconsin - Madison. He pursued his PhD in Educational Psychology with a focus in curriculum and instruction. From brains to games, his research focuses on the role of digital and physical active experiences in the development of formalized and abstract knowledge in STEM education. Furthermore, his work explores how informal educational experiences, such as video games, promote engagement and interest in STEM content. Through an educational neuroscience approach, he integrates qualitative and quantitative methods to better understand the relationship between learning and the underlying neural mechanisms.  Ultimately, his goal is to incorporate empirical understanding of STEM education into the instructional design of formal and digital educational experiences."
