## Abstract
Building on the recent growth of explicitly queer approaches to learning sciences scholarship, this paper explores the learning praxes of gender nonconforming noise musicians. The community of practice (CoP) surrounding noise music, a caustic subgenre of experimental music, provides a fruitful site of research because of its history of tensions related to marginalized gender identities. Through this study, I address the following research questions: What exclusionary practices do gender nonconforming musicians recognize in noise music scenes? And how do gender nonconforming noise musicians challenge those issues to produce a safer and more just informal learning environment? In analyzing interviews with 36 globally dispersed musicians, I discuss a series of exclusionary and liberatory learning praxes that create tensions and opportunities for marginalized participants. These findings hold implications for other studies of power within CoPs and informal learning contexts more broadly.
