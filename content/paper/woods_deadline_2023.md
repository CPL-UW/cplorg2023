## Abstract
While researchers in other fields have begun to more regularly theorize the learning that occurs at academic conferences, the learning sciences have broadly ignored this topic. We use this paper to begin conceptualizing the kinds of learning that occur at the Annual Meeting of the International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS). Taking a theoretical approach, we map the learning landscape of ISLS by applying a participational lens. We propose valuable possibilities of learning that occur both during and beyond the sanctioned events of the conference. We then critically reorient this work towards missing forms of knowledge production as a pathway forward. This paper represents a starting point for a valuable conversation about the kinds of learning that should occur at ISLS in future iterations.
