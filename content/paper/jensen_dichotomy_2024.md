## Abstract
One approach to teaching computer security in undergraduate computer science (CS) programs is to enforce and distribute it across the curriculum. Topics accessible at even the earliest of levels (CS0, CS1, CS2) have been identified and tools studied to teach them. However, we do not know much about the process, understanding, or knowledge that students bring in when doing computer security without any coursework in computer security. We employ a series of think-aloud programming sessions and short interviews following the format of Build-it, Break-it, Fix-it (BIBIFI) competitions. In this paper, we take a closer look at one build-it session in which the actions and words of the participant conflict with their perception of being capable of doing computer security.
