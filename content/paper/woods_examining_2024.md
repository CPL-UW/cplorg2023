## Abstract
While research has shown that students benefit from student-centered pedagogies, few studies have considered the benefits of this pedagogical approach for educators as they learn through teaching. In response to this need, we analyzed interviews, lesson plans, and video observations from five teachers in elementary schools across the United States who varyingly engaged student-centered and teacher-centered pedagogies. Our analyses revealed that the participating teachers developed a wide breadth of teacher knowledge regardless of their pedagogical approach. However, the teachers who employed student-centered teaching reported more pedagogical content knowledge gains for themselves than the teachers who used direct teaching.
