## Abstract
As computer security threats continue to grow, it is critical that all computer science (CS) students develop foundational security principles, including the complex but essential concept of a security mindset. However, much of the existing security education literature lacks grounding in the learning sciences, often portraying students as passive recipients of facts rather than active co-constructors of knowledge. To address this gap, we conducted a qualitative study to examine evidence of a security mindset in situ, laying the foundation for future research on when and how this mindset emerges. We analyzed think-aloud coding sessions modeled on the Build-It phase of the Build-It, Break-It, Fix-It (BIBIFI) competition. Despite limited or no prior exposure to computer security, participants exhibited core aspects of a security mindset, including secure design practices and threat perception. These findings suggest that students can demonstrate meaningful security reasoning even without formal coursework, highlighting opportunities for low-overhead interventions to cultivate a security mindset. Our results inform future research and pedagogical design targeting foundational security thinking in undergraduate CS education.
